.SH DESCRIPTION

Issues a batch request to release some or all of the vnodes of a batch job.

Generates a 
.I RelnodesJob 
(90) batch request and sends it to the server over the connection specified by 
.I connect.

You cannot release vnodes on the primary execution host.

You can use this on jobs and subjobs, but not on job arrays or ranges of subjobs.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP connect 8
Return value of 
.B pbs_connect().  
Specifies connection handle over which to send batch request to server.

.IP jobID 8
ID of job or subjob whose vnodes are to be released.  
.br
Format for a job:
.br
.I <sequence number>.<server name>
.br
Format for a subjob:
.br
.I <sequence number>[<index>].<server name>

.IP vnode_list 8
List of vnode names separated by plus signs ("+").

If 
.I vnode_list 
is a null pointer, this specifies that all the vnodes assigned to the
job that are not on the primary execution host are to be released.

.IP extend 8
Character string for extensions to command.  Not currently used.

.SH RETURN VALLUE
The routine returns 0 (zero) on success.

If an error occurred, the routine returns a non-zero exit value, and
the error number is available in the global integer 
.I pbs_errno.
