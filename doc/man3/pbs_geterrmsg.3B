.SH NAME
.B pbs_geterrmsg 
\- get error message for most recent PBS batch operation
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <pbs_error.h>
.br
#include <pbs_ifl.h>
.sp
.B char *pbs_geterrmsg(int connect)

.SH DESCRIPTION
Returns most recent error message text associated with a batch server request.

If a preceding batch interface library call over the connection
specified by 
.I connect 
returned an error from the server, the server may
have created an associated text message.  If there is a text message,
this function returns a pointer to the text message.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP connect 8
Return value of 
.B pbs_connect().  
Specifies connection handle over which to request error message from server.

.SH RETURN VALUE
If the server returned an error and created an error text string in
reply to a previous batch request, this function returns a pointer to
the text string.  The text string is null-terminated.

If the server does not have an error text string, this function
returns a null pointer.  The text string is a global variable; you do
not need to free it.
