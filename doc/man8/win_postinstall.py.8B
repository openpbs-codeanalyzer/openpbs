.TH win_postinstall.py 8B "20 November 2019" Local "PBS Professional"
.SH NAME
.B win_postinstall.py 
\- For Windows.  Configures PBS MoM or client


.SH SYNOPSIS
<PBS_EXEC>\\etc\\python win_postinstall.py 
-u <PBS service account> 
.br
        -p <PBS service account password> -t <installation type>   
.br
        -s <server name> [-c <path to scp command>]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B win_postinstall.py
command configures the PBS MoM and commands.  It performs
post-installation steps such as validating the PBS service account
username and password, installing the Visual C++ redistributable
binary, and creating the
.I pbs.conf
file in the PBS destination folder.

For an "execution" type of installation, it creates PBS_HOME, 
and registers and starts the PBS_MOM service.

When you use this command during an "execution" type installation of
PBS, the command automatically un-registers any old PBS MoM.

Available on Windows only.

.SH Required Privilege

You must have Administrator privilege to run this command.
