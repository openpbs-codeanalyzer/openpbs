# This is the config file for the scheduling policy
# FORMAT:  option: value prime_option
#	option 		- the name of what we are changing defined in config.h
#	value  		- can be boolean/string/numeric depending on the option
#	prime_option	- can be prime/non_prime/all ONLY FOR SOME OPTIONS

#### OVERALL SCHEDULING OPTIONS

#
# round_robin
#	Run a job from each queue before running second job from the
#	first queue.
#
#	PRIME OPTION

round_robin: False	all


#
# by_queue
#	Run jobs by queues.  If both round_robin and by_queue are not set,
#	The scheduler will look at all the jobs on on the server as one
#	large queue, and ignore the queues set by the administrator.
#
#	PRIME OPTION

by_queue: True		prime
by_queue: True		non_prime


#
# strict_ordering
#
#	Run jobs exactly in the order determined by the scheduling option
#	settings, so that we run the "most deserving" job as soon as possible
#	while adhering to site policy.  Note that strict_ordering can result
#	in significant idle time unless you use backfilling, which runs smaller
#	"less deserving" jobs provided that they do not delay the start time
#	of the "most deserving" job.
#
#       PRIME OPTION

strict_ordering: false	ALL

#### STARVING JOB OPTIONS

#
# help_starving_jobs
#
#	NOTE: The help_starving_jobs option is deprecated and will likely go away in a future release.
#	      Use job_sort_formula specifying eligible_time to establish equivalent behavior.
#
#	When this option is turned on, jobs which have been waiting a long
#	time are considered to be "starving".  The default amount of time for
#	a job to wait before it is considered starving is 24 hours, but you can
#	specify the minimum time in the max_starve scheduler parameter.  Note
#	that unless you use backfilling, this option can result in significant
#	idle time while starving jobs wait for resources.
#
#	PRIME OPTION

help_starving_jobs:	true	ALL

#
# max_starve
#	Maximum  duration before a job is considered starving.
#
#  	Examples:
#  	max_starve: 24:00:00
#  	This means that jobs waiting/queued for 24 hours will be given higher
#  	priority to run. NOTE: help_starving_jobs must be enabled.
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION

max_starve: 24:00:00

#### PRIMETIME OPTIONS:

# NOTE: to set primetime/nonprimetime see $PBS_HOME/sched_priv/holidays file

#
# backfill_prime
#
#	When backfill_prime is turned on, jobs are not allowed to cross from
#	primetime into non-primetime or vice versa.  This option is not related
#	to the backfill_depth server parameter.
#
#	PRIME OPTION

backfill_prime:	false	ALL

#
# prime_exempt_anytime_queues
#
#	Avoid backfill on queues that are not defined as primetime
#	or nonprimetime.
#	NOTE: This is not related to backfill for starving jobs.
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION

prime_exempt_anytime_queues:	false

#
# prime_spill
#
#	Time duration to allow jobs to cross-over or 'spill' into primetime or
#  	nonprimetime.
#	NOTE: This is used in conjunction with backfill_prime.
#
#	Usage: prime_spill: "HH:MM:SS"
#
#	Examples:
#	prime_spill: "2:00:00" 	PRIME
#	This means primetime jobs can spill into nonprimetime by up to 2 hours
#
#	prime_spill: "1:00:00" ALL
#	This will allow jobs to spill into nonprimeime or into primetime by
#	up to an hour.
#
#	PRIME OPTION
#

#prime_spill: 1:00:00	ALL

#
# primetime_prefix
# 	Prefix to define a primetime queue.
#	Jobs in primeime queues will only be run in primetime
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION

primetime_prefix: p_

#
# nonprimetime_prefix
#	Prefix to define non-primetime queues.
# 	Job in non-primetime queues will only be run in non-primetime
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION
nonprimetime_prefix: np_

#### SORTING OPTIONS:

# job_sort_key
#
#	Sort jobs by any resource known to PBS.
#	job_sort_key allows jobs to be sorted by any resource.  This
#	includes any admin defined resource resources.  The sort can be
#	ascending (low to high) or descending (high to low).
#
#	Usage: job_sort_key: "resource_name HIGH | LOW"
#
#	Allowable non resource keys:
#		fair_share_perc, preempt_priority, job_priority
#
#
#	Examples:
#
#	job_sort_key: "ncpus HIGH"
#	job_sort_key: "mem LOW"
#
#	This would have a 2 key sort, descending by ncpus and ascending by mem
#
#	PRIME OPTION
#

#job_sort_key: "cput LOW"	ALL

# node_sort_key
#
#	Sort nodes by any resource known to PBS.
#	node_sort_key is similar to job_sort_key but works for nodes.
#	Nodes can be sorted on any resource.  The resource value
#	sorted on is the resources_available amount.
#
#	Usage: node_sort_key: "resource_name HIGH | LOW"
#
#	non resource key: sort_priority
#
#	Example:
#
#	node_sort_key: "sort_priority HIGH"
#	node_sort_key: "ncpus HIGH"

#
# provision_policy
#
#	Determines how scheduler is going to select nodes to satisfy
#	provisioning request of a job.
#
#	"avoid_provision" sorts vnodes by requested AOE.
#	Nodes with same AOE are sorted on node_sort_key.
#
#	"aggressive_provision" lets scheduler select nodes first and then
#	provision if necessary. This is the default policy.
#
#  	Example:
#
#	provision_policy: "avoid_provision"
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION

provision_policy: "aggressive_provision"

#### SMP JOB OPTIONS:

#
# resources
#
#	Define resource limits to be honored by PBS.
#	The scheduler will not allow a job to run if the amount of assigned
#	resources exceeds the available amount.
#
#	NOTE: you need to encase the comma separated list of resources in
#	      double quotes (")
#  	Example:
#
#  	resources: "ncpus, mem, arch"
#
#  	This is ONLY schedules jobs based on available ncpus, mem, and arch
#  	within the cluster. Other resources requested by the job will not
#  	evaluated for availability.
#
#  	NOTE: Define new resources within
#		$PBS_HOME/server_priv/resourcedef file.
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION

resources: "ncpus, mem, arch, host, vnode, aoe, eoe"

#
# smp_cluster_dist
#
#	This option allows you to decide how to distribute jobs to all the
#	nodes on your systems.
#
#	pack 	    - pack as many jobs onto a node that will fit before
#		      running on another node
#	round_robin - run one job on each node in a cycle
#
#	PRIME OPTION

smp_cluster_dist: pack

#### FAIRSHARE OPTIONS

# NOTE: to define fairshare tree see $PBS_HOME/sched_priv/resources_group file

#
# fair_share
#	Schedule jobs based on usage and share values
#
#	PRIME OPTION
#

fair_share: false	ALL

#
# unknown_shares
#	The number of shares for the "unknown" group
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION
#
#	NOTE: To turn on fairshare and give everyone equal shares,
#	      Uncomment this line (and turn on fair_share above)

#unknown_shares: 10


#
# fairshare_usage_res
#	This specifies the resource to collect to fairshare from.
#	The scheduler will collect timing information pertaining to the
#	utilization of a particular resources to schedule jobs
#
#  	Example:
#  	fairshare_usage_res: cput
#
#	This collects the cput (cputime) resource.
#	NOTE: ONLY one resource can be collected.
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION
fairshare_usage_res: cput

#
# fairshare_entity
#	This is a job attribute which will be used for fairshare entities.
#	This can be anything from the username (euser) to the group (egroup)
#	etc.  It can also be "queue" for the queue name of the job
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION

fairshare_entity: euser

#
# fairshare_decay_time
#	The duration between when the scheduler decays the fairshare tree
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION

fairshare_decay_time: 24:00:00

#
# fairshare_decay_factor
# 	The factor in which the fairshare tree will be decayed by when it is decayed
# 	Example: 0.5 would mean a half-life
#
fairshare_decay_factor: 0.5

#
# fairshare_enforce_no_shares
#
#	Any fairshare entity with zero shares will never run.  If an
#	entity is in a group with zero shares, they will still not run.
#
# 	Usage: fairshare_enforce_no_shares: TRUE|FALSE
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION

# fairshare_enforce_no_shares: TRUE

#### PREEMPTIVE SCHEDULING OPTIONS

#
# preemptive_sched
#
#	Enables preemptive scheduling.
#	This will allow the scheduler to preempt lower priority
#	work to run higher priority jobs.
#
#	PRIME OPTION

preemptive_sched: true	ALL

#### PEER SCHEDULING OPTIONS

#
# peer_queue
#
#	Defines and enables the scheduler to obtain work from other PBS
#	clusters.
#
#	Peer scheduling works by mapping a queue on a remote server to a
#	queue on the local server.  Only one mapping can be made per line,
#	but multiple peer_queue lines can appear in this file. More then
#	one mapping can be made to the same queue.  The scheduler will
#	see the union of all the jobs of the multiple queues (local and remote).
#
#	Usage: peer_queue: "local_queue		remote_queue@remote_server"
#
#	Examples:
#	peer_queue: "workq		workq@svr1"
#	peer_queue: "workq		workq@svr2"
#	peer_queue: "remote_work	workq@svr3"
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION

#### DYNAMIC RESOURCE OPTIONS

#
# mom_resources
#
#	NOTE: The mom_resources option is deprecated and will likely go away in a future release.
#             Use exechost_periodic hook to set the resource values
#
#	Defines Dynamic Consumable Resources on a per node basis.
#
#	The mom_resources option is used to be able to query the MOMs to
#	set the value resources_available.res where res is a site defined
#	resource.  Each mom is queried with the resource name and the
#	return value is used to replace resources_available.res on that node.
#
#	NOTE: this is internal to the scheduler, these values will not
#	      be visible outside of the scheduler.
#
#	Usage: mom_resources: "res1, res2, res3, ... resN"
#
#	Example:
#	mom_resources: "foo"
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION

# server_dyn_res
#
#	Defines Dynamic Consumable Resources on a per job basis.
#
#	server_dyn_res allows the values of resources to be replaced by running
#	a program and taking the first line of output as the new value. For
#	instance, querying a licensing server for the available licenses.
#
#	NOTE: this value MUST be quoted (i.e. server_dyn_res: " ... " )
#
#	Examples:
#	server_dyn_res: "mem !/bin/get_mem"
#	server_dyn_res: "ncpus !/bin/get_ncpus"
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION

#### DEDICATED TIME OPTIONS

# NOTE: to set dedicated time see $PBS_HOME/sched_priv/dedicated_time file

#
# dedicated_prefix
#
#	Prefix to define dedicated time queues.
# 	All queues starting with this value are dedicated time queues and
#	jobs within these queues will only run during dedicated time.
#
# 	Example:
#
#	dedicated_prefix: ded
#
#	dedtime or dedicated time would be dedicated time queues
#	(along with anything else starting with ded).
#
#	NO PRIME OPTION
dedicated_prefix: ded
