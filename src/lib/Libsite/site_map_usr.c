 * site_map_user - map user name on a named host to user name on this host
 * @note
 *	for those of us who operate in a world of consistant
 *	user names, this routine just returns the original name.
 *
 *	This routine is "left as an exercise for the reader."
 *	If you don't have consistant names, its up to you to replace
 *	this code with what will work for you.
 *
 *	The input parameters cannot be modified.   If the replacement routine
 *	is to change the user's name, the new value should be kept in a static
 *	character array of size PBS_MAXUSER+1.
